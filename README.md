## What is Heroku?
Heroku is a container-based cloud platform as a servive (PaaS) that developers use to deploy, manage, and scale modern applications. In other words, it is a deployment tool meant to make life easier for developers.

Heroku runs apps in dynos, which are essentially virtual computers that can scale the power required to run those apps. This means that as your demand for your app grows, you can scale horizontally or vertically (for a price of course). Important to note that Heroku does not host your app as it is deployed to Amazon Web Services (AWS).
